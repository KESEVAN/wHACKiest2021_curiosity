Problem Statement: Post Pandemic Impact on Public Transportation.
There will be a substantial decline in the usage of public transportation
as more and more people prefer to commute in their own vehicle or use
private commute services than public transports.

Solution:
Our idea is to build an app which, given an input of destination route, time 
and the day will provide a list of public buses available along with the 
information such as crowd presence and the risk of infection. In turn,
Providing a user a choice to travel safely to his/her destination without
the hassle to wait for the next bus if the prior bus is crowded/unsafe.
